# OpenAI GPT-3 Virtual Speech Assistant - Community Run
This is a quick Speech -> ChatGPT-3 -> Speech wrapper I made for OpenAI's GPT-3 language models so you can talk to the AI through your mic and it will respond through your headphones/speakers.

**Key Points:**

- Response time will vary based on how bloated OpenAI API is. Typically its up to 10 seconds but 1-2 seconds when operating well.
- If you say the word 'goodbye' it will end the session and exit the file.
- If you say the word 'picture' it will use whatever else you said and use it to generate an image via Replicate. You can opt out of this by using main_no_images.py if you wish.

To get started, install the necessary modules via pip; pyttsx3, speechrecognition, openai, pyaudio and replicate - **you only need Replicate if you want image generation**.
```
pip install pyttsx3
pip install openai
pip install speechrecognition
pip install replicate
pip install pyaudio   
```

Then head over to https://beta.openai.com/login/ and make an account. Then generate an API key. **Once you have your openAI API Key, add it on line 7**. (If you want to do this probably create an environment variable, I'm just lazy)

If you want to use the image generation via Replicate then head over to https://replicate.com/account make an account and create an API key and replace it on line 8. If you want to skip this step then use main_no_images.py instead of main.py

Then simply execute the file by opening your terminal and running the python file:
py main.py (or main_no_images.py)

It will print the speech it detects from your mic, send that to the openAI API and then play the response through your default speakers.

Enjoy.
